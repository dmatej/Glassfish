/**
 * This class is a facade for the remote and local SerialContextProvider The
 * need for this class arose from the fact that we wanted to have a way of
 * lazily initializing the Remote SerialContextProvider. The TransientContext
 * member field has to be shared across both remote and local
 * SerialContextProvider. It could have been a static variable but to avoid
 * issues of static variables with multiple threads, etc, this class has been
 * designed. The ORB needs to be initialized before the call to
 * initRemoteProvider()
