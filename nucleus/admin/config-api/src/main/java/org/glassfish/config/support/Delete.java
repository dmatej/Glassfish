/**
 * Delete command annotation
 *
 * A method annotated with the Delete annotation will generate a generic implementation of a delete administrative
 * command responsible for delete instances of the type as referenced by the annotated method.
 *
 * The deleted type is determine by the annotated method which must follow one of the two following patterns : List<X>
 * getXs(); or void setX(X x);
 *
 * X is the type of instance that will be deleted, the name of the method is actually immaterial. So for example, the
 * following
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * &#64;Delete
 * public List<Foo> getAllMyFoos();
 * &#64;Delete
 * public void setMySuperFoo(Foo foo);
 * &#64;Delete
 * public List<Foo> getFoos();
 * &#64;Delete
 * public List<Foo> getFoo();
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * will all be valid annotated methods.
 *
 * The instance to be removed from the parent must be resolved by the resolver attribute. The resolver can use injection
 * or the command invocation parameters (using the {@link org.glassfish.api.Param} annotation) to get enough information
 * to look up or retrieve the instance to be deleted.
 *
 * Usually, most instances can be looked up by using the instance type and its key (provided by the --name or --target
 * parameters for instance).
 *
 * See {@link Create} for initialization information
