    Return the ObjectNames of all MBeans whose properties match all the specified
    regular expressions.  Both property names and values may be searched.

    A starting set may be specified by using an ObjectName pattern.
    This can greatly improve the performance of the search by restricting the
    set of MBeans which are examined; otherwise all registered MBeans must be examined.

    The regexNames[ i ] pattern corresponds to regexValues[ i ].  A value of null
    for any item is taken to mean "match anything".  Thus specifing null for
    'regexNames' means "match any name" and specifying regexNames[ i ] = null means
    to match only based on regexValues[ i ] (and vice versa).
