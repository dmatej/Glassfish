     * steady-pool-size. When an instance is removed from the pool, it is
     * replenished asynchronously, so that the pool size is at or above the

     * If the max pool size is exceeded the bean id destroyed immediately.
     * A pool cleaning thread, executes at an interval defined by
     * pool-idle-timeout-in-seconds. This thread reduces the pool size to
     * steady-pool-size, in steps defined by pool-resize-quantity. If the pool
     * is empty, the required object will be created and returned immediately.
     * This prevents threads from blocking till the pool is replenished by the

     * equal to the max-pool-size.
