/**
 * Interceptor SPI that {@link org.glassfish.contextpropagation.weblogic.workarea.WorkContext} provider
 * implementations should call on to marshal and unmarshal the current
 * {@link org.glassfish.contextpropagation.weblogic.workarea.WorkContextMap}.
 *
 * An instance of the workarea runtime implementing
 * <code>WorkContextMapInterceptor</code> can be obtained as follows:
 * <p> <pre>
 * WorkContextMapInterceptor interceptor
 *   = WorkContextHelper.getWorkContextHelper().getInterceptor();
 *</pre>
 *
 * It is also possible to check the current thread for the presence of
 * a {@link org.glassfish.contextpropagation.weblogic.workarea.WorkContextMap}, and obtain the interceptor, in one
 * call:
 * <p> <pre>
 * WorkContextMapInterceptor interceptor
 *   = WorkContextHelper.getWorkContextHelper().getLocalInterceptor();
 *</pre>
 *
 * Note that the latter form is not suitable for service providers
 * that need to infect the current thread with
 * {@link org.glassfish.contextpropagation.weblogic.workarea.WorkContextMap} data since they will always need to
 * obtain an interceptor instance.
 *
 * There are three use cases for interceptor usage, one for remote
 * invocations and two for local invocations. In the remote case the
 * send/receive functions are used to marshal and unmarshal
 * WorkContextMap data from an appropriate stream. The stream is
 * provided by the service provider and may encode the data as binary,
 * XML or whatever.
 *
 * In the local case service providers generally need to copy context
 * data from one thread to another. This is done via copy/restore and
 * the interceptor will ensure that only data that should be copied
 * is. The other local case is where the service provider needs to
 * propagate context data remotely in a non-standard way. In this case
 * the the send/receive calls are used first to marshal the data and
 * then suspend/resume used to prevent the data being marshaled by
 * other remote mechanisms.
